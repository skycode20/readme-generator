  ## Description    

  The README Generator is an application that simplifies the process of making a README file that explains the inner workings of your project. This README generator matter because it greatly reduces the amount of time one spends in figuring out how to compose and format a markdown file into something that is functional and easy to read. This is important because as anyone completing big projects, especially those technological by nature, should be able to focus more time on the polish of a project rather than laboring to explain it.     
  
  The inspiration behind this project was me finding a way to leverage my technical knowledge to develop a tool I could use right away and refine over time.     

  The README generator works in a very simple way. The user will be prompted with questions/request for information about yourself, the project details, licenses, etc. Once you complete all of the prompts the application will generate a pre-formatted markdown file that will have all of the inputted information contained within the relevant sections. The new README file will contain the title of the user's project and will automatically be saved in the files. The markdown file will contain the framework and most of the content for a professional README in a matter of minutes. It honestly is a game changer for me. 

  I learned a lot while developing this application. One of my most important lessons was how organized a markdown should look. Before my approach to writing a README file was much like my approach to writing papers. I would approach each one differently but because this is a relatively new concept to me I didn't understand effective formats for README's like I did with essays. So now that I have this newfound knowledge my project README's will be greater than ever.

  In the future I will be adding more badges that track more of the licenses and coding languages utilized. Also adding more prompts to be more specific with some of the information requested for the description and usage sections to make it even more intuitive for the user.
