  ## Description    

  The README Generator is an application that simplifies the process of making a README file that explains the inner workings of your project. This README generator matter because it greatly reduces the amount of time one spends in figuring out how to compose and format a markdown file into something that is functional and easy to read. This is important because as anyone completing big projects, especially those technological by nature, should be able to focus more time on the polish of a project rather than laboring to explain it. 
  
  The inspiration behind this project was me finding a way to leverage my technical knowledge to develop a tool I could use right away and refine over time. 

  The README generator works in a very simple way. The user will be prompted with questions/request for information about yourself, the project details, licenses, etc. Once you complete all of the prompts the application will generate a pre-formatted markdown file that will have all of the inputted information contained within the relevant sections. The new README file will contain the title of the user's project and will automatically be saved in the files. The markdown file will contain the framework and most of the content for a professional README in a matter of minutes. It honestly is a game changer for me. 
  
  In the future I will be adding more badges that track more of the licenses and coding languages utilized.   It runs inside of CLI (Command Line Interface) 

  At a minimum, your project README needs a title and a short description explaining the what, why, and how. What was your motivation? Why did you build this project? (Note: The answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.") What problem does it solve? What did you learn? What makes your project stand out? If your project has a lot of features, consider adding a heading called "Features" and listing them here.
